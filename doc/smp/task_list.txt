1. SMP startup,initialization,make AP to run,...;
2. Spin lock in SMP;
3. Interrupt dispatching;
4. HelloX code revision;


Conclusion already made:
1. Only apply spin lock on the protecting of shared data structures;
2. Spin lock with spin and interrupt disabled can fit every scenario,apply this mechanism in early stage of HelloX's SMP support;
3. GetCurrentKernelThread's implementation should be revised,each CPU has it's own value respectively;
4.
