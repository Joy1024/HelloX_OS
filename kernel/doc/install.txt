Steps to install HelloX on PC manually:
 1. Create a bootable USB stick by using make_usb_boot;
 2. Load the PC using this USB stick;
 3. USB stick will be loaded by HelloX as C:;
 4. Turn off logging(sysdiag->syslog);
 4. Check harddisk status using fdisk, make sure \\.\ATADISK0 appear;
 5. Copy bootsect to \\.\ATADISK0, then boot sector is initialized;
    -- copy bootsect \\.\ATADISK0 //fs command view;
 6. Partition the harddisk using fdisk, choose one partition as active;
    -- partadd command //fdisk command view.
 7. Reload the PC, then format one partition as FAT32, and reload again;
    -- format \\.\ATAPARTx FAT32 hxsys  //fdisk command view.
 8. Copy the osloadr.bin, oskernl.bin, tftpsrv.exe and usragent.bin into just formated partition;
 9. Create several system directories on system partition:
    9.1 bin, contains binary applications;
	9.2 syslog, contains system level logs;
	9.3 data, contains system and application level data;
	9.4 syscfg, contains system configuration files;
	9.5 hellox, main directory of hellox;
	    9.5.1 hellox\system32, system modules or other files;
 10. Copy the corresponding files under above directories to target from boot device;
 11. Pull out the USB stick and load PC again, it should boot from HelloX;

A dedicated application maybe created in future to simplify this procedure.

NOTE!!:
1. There are issues in USB system of hellox, it can not work in certain platform;
   -- The blackbox with 6 ports is this type;
2. So in order to access USB stick, BIOS IDE should be enabled(in config.h), and
   use the BIOS I/O to access USB stick. The USB stick will be identified as C:
   by hellox;
3. But the USB system can work in certain platform, so if BIOS IDE is enabled, then
   could lead conflict since the USB stick is identified by BIOS IDE, and also
   identified by hellox as D:;
4. Then system will crash when boot, since log manager will create file on C:, this
   lead to BIOS to access USB stick;
5. So please carefully consider to enable or disable BIOS IDE in certain platform.

SOLUTION: DO NOT USE ANY BIOS FUNCTION, MAKE USB FUNCTION WORK WELL.
