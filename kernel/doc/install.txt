Steps to install HelloX on PC manually:
 1. Create a bootable USB stick by using make_usb_boot;
 2. Load the PC using this USB stick;
 3. USB stick will be loaded by HelloX as C:;
 4. Turn off logging(sysdiag->syslog);
 4. Check harddisk status using fdisk, make sure \\.\ATADISK0 appear;
 5. Copy bootsect to \\.\ATADISK0, then boot sector is initialized;
 6. Partition the harddisk using fdisk, choose one partition as active;
 7. Reload the PC, then format one partition as FAT32, and reload again;
 8. Copy the osloadr.bin and usragent.bin into just formated partition;
 9. Create several system directories on system partition:
    9.1 bin, contains binary applications;
	9.2 syslog, contains system level logs;
	9.3 data, contains system and application level data;
	9.4 syscfg, contains system configuration files;
 10. Pull out the USB stick and load PC again, it should boot from HelloX;

A dedicated application maybe created in future to simplify this procedure.
