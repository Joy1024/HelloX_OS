Upgrade process through TFTP function:
Preparation:
1. Compile any kernel or application modules, make them ready on PC;
2. Make sure the TFTP client is installed on local PC;
3. Network connection between local PC and hellox box is established;
4. Disable windows firewall on local PC(or set the network as no-public);
5. Make sure tftpsrv.exe(or examapp.exe) is in C:\ directory of hellox.

Procedures for upgrade HelloX to version 1.89:
1. Start TFTP server on hellox: loadapp c:\tftpsrv.exe 69 &;
2. Run tftp client and put the target file into hellox server, for example:
   tftp 192.168.43.95 put osloadr.bin hxldr.bin //Put osloadr.bin to hellox, if
                                                //os loader is revised.

   tftp 192.168.43.95 put oskernl.bin hxkernl.bin //Put kernel file to hellox.
   in order to avoid the failure of xfer that lead kernel file cruption, use
   another name when put to server. So even the xfer failure, you can reload
   hellox correctly;
   NOTE!!!: Please turn off windows firewall on the nework, otherwise failure may
   occur.
3. Then rename the kernel files as following:
   3.1 Delete the old version of osloadr and kernel file;
   3.2 Rename the hxldr.bin to osloadr.bin(copy hxldr.bin osloadr.bin),
       and rename hxkernl.bin to oskernl.bin(same as above);
4. The kernel files in hellox will be the new ones;
5. Update any other application or module through the same procedure;
6. Check if the files are put OK through dir command, make sure osloadr.bin,
   oskernl.bin, tftpsrv.exe are in root directory;
7. Upload configure files under C:\SYSCFG\ directory if not exist;
8. Reload hellox, new version should work;
