 *  HelloX kernel is the binary code and static data of OS kernel,
 *  but does not include the dynamic data part,which will be allocated
 *  from USABLE MEMORY,by calling KMemAlloc,in unit of
 *  4K or any size.
 *  The kernel reserved memory space's page table is created in
 *  process of virtual memory manager's initialization,
 *  which calls page index manager's init routine accordingly,
 *  so OS kernel can access these KMEM_KERNEL_EXCLUDE_END
 *  (64M) space freely without warry about the page fault.
 *  
 *  The USSABLE MEMORY is seperated into 2 parts farther:
 *  1. The 4K allocation unit part,starts from KMEM_4KPOOL_START
 *     and it's length is KMEM_4KPOOL_LENGTH,currently is 10M;
 *  2. The any size allocation unit part,from KMEM_ANYSIZEPOOL_START
*      and it's length is KMEM_ANYSIZEPOOL_LENGTH,currently
*      the start address of any size pool is 0xC00000.
 *  The 4K unit part can be used by I/O driver buffer,
 *  and other functions that need large buck of memories.
 *  The any size unit part can be used by kernel objects
 *  that need fragmented memory blocks,such as thread object,
 *  synchronous object,file object,kernel thread's stack,etc.
 *  All these 2 regions always reside in memory and are not
 *  managemend by PageFrameManager,so aren't be swapped out
 *  from memory.
 *  
 *  SO THE MINIMAL RAM SPACE THAT HELLOX CAN RUN MUST NOT 
 *  LESS THAN 64M.
 *
 *  The MINIKER.BIN's code size is 48K,but there is a 16K
 *  space from history,we just keep it.:-)
 *  The physical system layout table is in 12K offset from
 *  MINIKER.BIN's start address,so it's memory address is
 *  0x103000 since MINIKER.BIN is relocated into 1M memory.
 *  
 *  Other RAM space start from KMEM_KERNEL_EXCLUDE_END is
 *  page frames that managed by PageFrameManager and alloc
 *  to applications or device drivers,in maner of using
 *  VirtualAlloc routine.The pages in this range can be
 *  swapped out.
 *  
 *  OS kernel developers could adjust the actual memory
 *  layout by changing the corresponding macros with
 *  prefix of 'KMEM',such as KMEM_ANYSIZEPOOL_START,
 *  KMEM_KERNEL_EXCLUDE_END,etc.

 *  Same as most OS,HelloX's memory space is divided
 *  into kernel space and user space.
 *  Applications running in user space can not access
 *  kernel space directly without system call.But
 *  the kernel code can access user space freely.
 *  The kernel space is from the start lineary address
 *  to KMEM_KRNLSPACE_END,or KMEM_USERSPACE_START,these
 *  2 macros are same.The kernel space is seperated
 *  into 2 parts farther:the kernel reserved part,
 *  which is from 0 to KMEM_KRNLSPACE_START,and the
 *  rest part,which is from KMEM_KRNLSPACE_START to
 *  KMEM_KRNLSPACE_END.
 *  The reserved part of kernel space resides in
 *  memory always,and initialized in process of
 *  system initialization,with physical RAM space
 *  allocated to it.The rest part of kernel
 *  space is reserved the lineary space only and
 *  no physical RAM is allocated.Kernel code can
 *  use this space by calling VirtualAlloc routine
 *  to reserve page table and physical memory(from
 *  paged pool).Kernel libraries that common used
 *  will be loaded into this range.
 *
 *  The user space start from KMEM_USERSPACE_START
 *  to KMEM_USERSPACE_END,currently this range's
 *  length is 2G in 32 bits.More detailed layout of
 *  user space as follows:
 *
 *     | ----------------- |<---- KMEM_USERSTACK_END(KMEM_USERSPACE_END/KMEM_IOMAP_START)

 *
 *  The whole space is seperated into 4 parts:
 *  User application,the executable image of the application
 *  is loaed into this region;
 *  User heap,dynamic allocated memory from application
 *  by using malloc is reserved in this region;
 *  User library region,the libraries that for this application
 *  use only will be loaded into this region;
 *  User stack,stack region for user application.Each user
 *  thread has it's own stack,these stacks are all allocated
 *  from this region.
 *  Memories of these regions are allocated on demand,i.e,when
 *  a new process is created,only certain number of pages of
 *  these region are allocated,the actual number of page is defined
 *  by KMEM_USERXXXX_DEFAULTPGNUM macros,or indicated by the
 *  input parameters of create process APIs.
 *  APIs are offered by kernel to shrink or enlarge the default
 *  size of all these regions.
 *  Currently all these 4 regions' total length is same,that
 *  is 512M.This value can be changed by redefine the corresponding
 *  macros and recompile HelloX's kernel.
