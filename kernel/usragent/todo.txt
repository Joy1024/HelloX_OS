1. Implement CreatePEB in front of the entry of user agent. The PED is
   created and initialized in this routine, start from KMEM_PEB_START
   address. Define the PEB struct before implement it;
2. Define a struct used to manage DLL, could get something from PE header
   and section headers;
3. Define and implement a queue to hold all loaded DLLs, the first one
   is used to hold application's PE module;
4. Implement the dependency of import symbols, linking all DLL modules
   together. Recursive symbol reference should be supported;
5. Load DLLs from application's current directory, and from system32
   dir if not exist;
6. Show warning message if the depend DLL is not found, terminate current
   process;
7. Implement process command under sysdiag, use different level 2 subcommand
   to control the output;
8. Upgrade kvalist command under sysdiag, to support output one process's
   va list;
9. Implement dummy or agent DLL to run windows console application;
10. Revise DoReserveAndCommit routine in VMM, to support any kind size's
   allocation, since current can not allocate larger than 8M;
11. May re-arrange the virtual memory layout in kernel, to reserve the low
   end 2G space for application, because some PE exe does not contain
   relocation entries;
12.
